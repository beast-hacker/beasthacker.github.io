    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>My name is Alex Conway. I live in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

    <p>I built this small website as a place to test ideas, experiment with new tools, and ship tiny prototypes in public. I don’t expect everything here to be polished or final. That’s intentional.</p>

    <p>Over time, this site will evolve as my interests evolve.</p>
